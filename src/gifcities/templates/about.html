GifCities was originally a special project of the Internet Archive done as part of our 20th Anniversary to highlight and celebrate fun aspects of the amazing history of the web as represented in the web archive and the Wayback Machine. In 2024 it was recreated with a more sophisticated search backend and a new website.
</p>

<p>
GeoCities was an early web hosting service, started in 1994 and acquired by Yahoo in 1999, with which users could create their own custom websites. The platform hosted over 38 million user-built pages and was at one time the third most visited site on the web. In 2009, Yahoo announced it was closing down the service, at which point the Internet Archive attempted to archive as much of the content as possible. More information on GeoCities can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>

<p>
For the GifCities project, we used the Internet Archive's <a href="https://archive.org/web/geocities.php">GeoCities Closing Crawl</a>. Mining this <a href="https://archive.org/details/geocities&tab=about">collection</a>, we extracted over 4,500,000 animated GIFs (1,600,000 unique images) and then indexed them using machine learning and metadata to map search terms to image files. Each GIF links back to the original GeoCities page on which it was used.
</p>

<p>
The GeoCities web archive has been explored by other projects. The Internet Archiveâ€™s own Jason Scott has highlighted <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction/">"Under Construction"</a> GIFs. Librarians at North Carolina State University <a href="https://archive.org/details/HallofGifs">used GeoCities GIFs</a> in their data visualization lab. The GIFs have also been featured in creative projects such as Greg Niemeyer's <a href="http://www.bampfa.org/program/gif-collider-10">GifCollider</a> at <a href="https://bampfa.org">BAMPFA</a>. Researchers such as <a href="https://ianmilligan.ca">Ian Milligan</a> data mined the full GeoCities web archive to explore community formation. The resulting corpus of GeoCities materials has been re-staged and studied by Dragan Espenschied and Olia Lialina of the <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute">GeoCities Research Institute</a>, describing the important role of GeoCities vernacular&mdash;templates, background, MIDIs and of course GIFs&mdash;in the formation of Digital Folklore Their Tumblr blog <a href="http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com">One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age Photo Op</a> chronologically delivers a new screen shots of  GeoCities home pages every 20 minutes, created with historically accurate operating systems and browsers.

<p>
Thanks for the project go first and foremost to the millions of everyday citizens that built such incredible pages and GIFs in GeoCities. We also owe special thanks to Yahoo for their guidance and open communication about the GeoCities closure. We also thank the independent volunteer team of archivers at <a href="http://archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a> for their efforts to <a href="http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Geocities">preserve GeoCities</a> and <a href="http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Geocities_URL_Lists">contribute URL surveys</a> to the project. Thanks go as well to the efforts of the tireless Internet Archive staff that work to archive and make accessible our ongoing work to preserve the web for both today's users and for posterity.
